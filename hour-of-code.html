                <p class="hoc-paragraph">The main purpose of the event, which took place at School No. 229(Baku) was to introduce the 29 young minds to the world of
                    programming. By the end of the lesson, pupils were able to understand basic
                    algorithmic actions, block-based coding, debugging and were able to work with simple
                    animations.
                     With the help of slides, the session has started with Natig displaying some brief
                    information about the ADA University – we covered important aspects such as the
                    amount of different carrier choices, the language of study, and the bright future of an
                    ADA student. Specifically, we discussed the School of IT and Engineering.
                     After being done with the presentation, we set up the environment for the event. The
                    team also informed the pupils that the most active of them, will be rewarded. The
                    purpose of this was promote healthy competition among students and boost their
                    motivation.
                     As the first 5 problems of the Classic Maze puzzle were a breeze, which covered the
                    most basic block-based coding actions such as moving forward, turning left and right,
                    students have quickly moved on to the next puzzles. These puzzles are where the first
                    struggles have come up, as students were now required not only to connect their sprite
                    to the target, to complete the puzzle, but also to find the easiest and shortest way to do
                    so. The young minds were now informed about loops, in our case, it is called the
                    repetition block. Although puzzles 6, 7 and 8 were not as complicated, they took longer
                    to be done with. While Natig was explaining and elaborating on the 6th puzzle by
                    searching for some volunteers, Masud, Maharram and Fidan went on to help pupils that
                    quickly got to the 9th question, which was one of the most troubling ones. The common
                    issue among the students on this puzzle was understanding which commands are
                    supposed to be in the repeat block and which are not. Through interactive explanations,
                    we managed to enlighten the pupils.
                     Later on, students were introduced to the new type of block – the repeat until-do
                    loop block. While similar to the repeat block, it is distinct – since it does not require to
                    specify the number of times the loop must be executed. The repeat until-do block is to
                    be executed as long as the sprite has not met the target. Hence, students spotted the
                    similarities and did not need further explanation when working on puzzles 10 and 11.
                     Puzzle 14 was another struggling point of the students, – even though it consists of
                    commands that our team has explained to the pupils earlier, it might take some
                    thinking time to find the correct algorithm, considering that there is a new type of block
                    command – if statements. With a little bit of guidance from all team members,
                    students managed to solve the puzzle the following way: first, we encouraged them to
                    build an algorithm with no use of the loop blocks; after recognizing the pattern, they
                    have successfully placed the loops. To consolidate this information, Natig asked for a
                    volunteer to demonstrate puzzle 15 on the board and elaborate on the thought process.
                    Out of many students, three came up to the whiteboard and solved the puzzle as a
                    team, while demonstrating it to those who struggled with this problem. They have
                    noticed that the sprite, in this case, must not turn left, only right, which meant that the
                    sprite should be moving forward if there is no path to the right.
                     As the students progressed to the final 5 puzzles, the class had its top three finalists.
                    They were awarded notebooks for their problem-solving skills and speed.
                     On the 18th puzzle, students faced an extended version of the if loop – if-else loop.
                    However, this was more than easy to deal with for them. They quickly realised which
                    commands must be placed in empty spaces. To ensure that all the pupils understood
                    the idea of this extended loop, team members have once again searched for volunteers
                    to help others clarify their knowledge of the block. Our puzzle of choice was the 19th
                    question. The chosen participants no longer needed as much help from the team
                    members as they did at the beginning of the lesson – showcasing the result of
                    successful topic coverage.
                     Although the rest of the students fundamentally understood the basics of
                    algorithmic thinking – especially that the code is read by the compiler from top to
                    bottom, some had trouble with the 20th question. Since it was the most advanced topic,
                    nested ifs, many of the pupils struggled for with it. At first, they were not able to
                    understand, which commands and/or blocks must be nested. However, after with the
                    help of the collaborative approach, the whole class, as a team, managed to quickly find
                    the solution to the issue – they realised that the nested “if” must be in the “else’s”
                    empty space of the first If loop.
                     After confirming that each student had successfully completed the Maze Puzzle with
                    understanding, team members awarded each student a sticker pack to recognize their
                    determination and hard work. Following this, we held a certification ceremony and
                    concluded the event by expressing our gratitude to all the students, the school
                    administration, and ADA University. We also want to note that, as Team 33, we made
                    every effort to ensure that each student fully engaged with the lesson and stayed
                    motivated throughout. As a result, the event lasted for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
